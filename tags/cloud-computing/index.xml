In this session, we will explore how a Kubernetes-based approach has been applied in the design and implementation of SECA’s advanced cloud APIs, strengthening the digital infrastructure for the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will present practical use cases that showcase the benefits of this architecture, highlighting the importance of the open-source community in the project’s evolution. Join us for this exploration of how Kubernetes is not just a technical implementation, but the foundation on which to build the next level of cloud innovation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>[TALK] Beyond cloud borders with Aruba Managed Kubernetes and Liqo</title><link>https://amedeopalopoli.com/publications/italy-cloudnativedays2024/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amedeopalopoli.com/publications/italy-cloudnativedays2024/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a period marked by the rapid adoption of multi-cloud solutions and the constant pursuit of AI capabilities, the need for efficient and flexible resource management becomes crucial. Aruba Managed Kubernetes and Liqo offer new ways to address these challenges. Aruba Managed Kubernetes simplifies deployment and ensures security and high availability. The multi-cloud federation enabled by Liqo allows for effective and seamless resource management, as well as enabling workload mobility. Together, they enhance operational flexibility—for example, by optimizing the AI value chain and enabling GPU sharing—and more broadly by managing complex, adaptable cloud architectures. This integration not only increases efficiency but also opens new paths for innovation in the hybrid cloud space.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QoS and performance metrics for container-based virtualization in cloud environments</title><link>https://amedeopalopoli.com/publications/performancemetrics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amedeopalopoli.com/publications/performancemetrics/</guid><description>&lt;p>Current cloud deployments heavily depend on hypervisor-based virtualizations. The overarching characteristics of Docker and containerization have given them a momentum in their widespread adoption recently as alternatives for their counterparts. However, little research has been done for comparing the QoS of both technologies, thus leaving the domain without widely accepted performance metrics. Aiming at informing the decision of the best fit in a specific cloud deployment, we have designed performance metrics that compare the performance of both designs in an in-house cluster deployed by using OpenStack. We focus on well-established representatives as baselines, including KVM from the hypervisor-based side, LXD from the container-based side in addition to Docker.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Containerization in Cloud Computing: performance analysis of virtualization architectures</title><link>https://amedeopalopoli.com/publications/thesisbook/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amedeopalopoli.com/publications/thesisbook/</guid><description>&lt;p>The increasing adoption of cloud computing is strongly influenced by emerging of technologies whose aim is to improve the development and deployment processes of enterprise applications. The goal of this thesis is to investigate one of these solutions, called “containerization”, and deeply analyze how this solution can be included in cloud infrastructures as an alternative to complementary solutions like virtual machines. So far, the virtual machine model has been the predominant solution. The key differentiator nature that containers offer has stimulated an increasing adoption of this technology because improves resource management, resource sharing, and it guarantees substantial improvements regarding provisioning time of single instances.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
