In today’s technology landscape, Kubernetes has established itself as an essential tool for container orchestration, becoming a benchmark platform for cloud innovation. In this session, we will explore how a Kubernetes-based approach has been applied in the design and implementation of SECA’s advanced cloud APIs, strengthening the digital infrastructure for the future.

We will present practical use cases that showcase the benefits of this architecture, highlighting the importance of the open-source community in the project’s evolution. Join us for this exploration of how Kubernetes is not just a technical implementation, but the foundation on which to build the next level of cloud innovation.
