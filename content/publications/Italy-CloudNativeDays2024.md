In a period marked by the rapid adoption of multi-cloud solutions and the constant pursuit of AI capabilities, the need for efficient and flexible resource management becomes crucial. Aruba Managed Kubernetes and Liqo offer new ways to address these challenges. Aruba Managed Kubernetes simplifies deployment and ensures security and high availability. The multi-cloud federation enabled by Liqo allows for effective and seamless resource management, as well as enabling workload mobility. Together, they enhance operational flexibility—for example, by optimizing the AI value chain and enabling GPU sharing—and more broadly by managing complex, adaptable cloud architectures. This integration not only increases efficiency but also opens new paths for innovation in the hybrid cloud space.
