**CNCF Kubeastronaut | Cloud Architect @ ArubaCloud | Innovation Addicted | Expert in Containerization and Cloud Computing.**

I was born in Calabria in 1993 and moved to Bologna in 2011 to pursue a degree in Computer Science Engineering. After completing my studies, I began my professional journey in Milan, where I've been working as a Cloud Architect since 2018.
In 2021, I married my better half, Maria, and since 2023, we’ve been the proud parents of a sweet and loving little boy, Carmine.

I embraced Kubernetes in 2016 during my Master's thesis in Computer Engineering at the University of Bologna. During this time, I deepened my interest in containerization and the deployment of cloud-native applications on Kubernetes through research studies that led to publications in scientific journals such as ACM and IEEE. The cloud-native ecosystem and its related technologies have been an integral part of my professional journey, supported by continuous learning and various certifications, including AWS Solutions Architect and Elasticsearch Certified Engineer. 

I firmly believe Kubernetes has the potential to radically transform how organizations develop, deploy, and manage their applications. Fascinated by the rise of the CNCF and its role in supporting an interoperable and scalable cloud-native ecosystem, I pursued Kubernetes certifications through The Linux Foundation. I successfully achieved CKA, CKAD, CKS, KCNA, and KCSA—ranking among the first Italians to complete the recent KubeAstronaut program.
